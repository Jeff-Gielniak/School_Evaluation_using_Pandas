Using provided Educational metrics, I evaluated schools by creating various Dataframes by using various python tools like groupby, binning, averaging and sorting.  The Dataframes help display the story the data is telling us.

In general, the most impactful variable to weather or not students are Passing in reading and math is Charter Schools vs District schools.  Charter School were much more successful in getting a higher percentage of students to pass than District school (roughly 90% vs 53%).  Additionally, Small and Medium schools were also much more successful at having students pass compared to Large schools (over 2000 students).  To be clear, District schools in general are larger than Charter schools, so there is some overlap there. 
Also, the amount of money a school spends per student doesn't have a correlation to higher percentages of students passing.  If fact, many of the lowest per student spending schools had the highest passing rates. Finally, passing percentages are very consistent between grades ninth through twelfth for a given school, which means schools don't get better at educating students the older they get.
